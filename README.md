I'm just this guy, y'know? 

If you're reading this, I can only assume that you're lost. Welcome, traveller, to my Github README.MD. 

I mostly do video game modding/scripting. Usually while swearing profusely. Sometimes I even make something that works. 

Hence, my skills primarily lie in staring at arcane code and/or fiddling with convoluted, undocumented systems and trying to figure out some way of bodging it to do what I want. This may sound inefficient, because it is. Oh well.
